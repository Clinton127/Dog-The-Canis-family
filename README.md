    <h2 class="sglow">About Dogs</h2>
    <p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over <em>14,000 years ago</em> and before the development of agriculture. Experts estimate that due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.<br><br></p>

<p>Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones <strong>(with the exception of the tail),</strong> powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared to humans, dogs have an inferior visual acuity, a superior sense of smell, and a relatively large olfactory cortex. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military.

Communication in dogs includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste).<br><br> They mark their territories by urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a new environment. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior; this adaptation includes being able to understand and communicate with humans. The human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent study, and dogs' influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".

The global dog population is estimated at 700 million to 1 billion, distributed around the world. The dog is the most popular pet in the United States, present in 34–40% of households. In developed countries, around 20% of dogs are kept as pets, while 75% of the population in developing countries largely consists of feral and community dogs.</p>

    <h3>Breeds</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><h3 class= "sglow"><strong>French Bulldog</strong></h3></li><img src= "https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/french_bull_dog.jpeg.jpg"><br><p style= "color: green;"/>The French bulldog is a small, nonsporting dog that originated in France from crosses between small native dogs and toy Bulldogs. It has a short, smooth coat that comes in various colors, such as brindle, fawn, and white. It has large, erect ears that resemble those of a bat. It is an affectionate and easygoing house dog that thrives on attention and has low exercise requirements13. It typically weighs around 16-28 pounds (7-13 kg) and lives for about 10-12 years.<br><br>
<li><h3 class= "sglow"><strong>Labrador retriever</strong></h3></li><img src= "https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/retriever.jpeg.jpg"><br><p style= "color: blue;"/>The Labrador retriever has long been synonymous with the perfect family dog. As playful, energetic and loyal dogs, they’re ideal for almost any living situation. They’re also easy to train since they’re eager to please their owners.

An intelligent dog with boundless energy, the Labrador retriever will need a good amount of space and time to exercise. More than two hours of exercise per day is recommended for this breed, according to The Kennel Club. They also need mental stimulation—think puzzle feeders or toys, training and sports.

Labs have a thick double coat so they are prone to shedding, but you can reduce this by brushing them at least once per week. During high-shedding seasons like spring and fall, you may need to brush them daily.
<li><h4 class= "sglow"> <strong>Golden retriever</strong></h4></li><img src="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/golden.jpeg.jpg"><br><p style="color: red:"/>Golden retrievers, similar to their labrador counterparts, are also wonderful family companions. Gentle and friendly, these dogs are known for their affectionate and loving demeanor.

When it comes to exercise, goldens need more than two hours a day, per The Kennel Club. These smart and active dogs love playing fetch and swimming. They also require mental stimulation and do well with training.

Goldens have a longer and thicker coat than labradors, making them high shedders. It’s recommended to brush them daily or at least twice per week.

These canines have similar health concerns to <em>labradors</em>, as they’re also prone to hip dysplasia, ACL tears and joint issues. Research also suggests that goldens unfortunately have a higher risk of cancer than most dogs.


<li><h5 class= "sglow"><strong>German shepherd</strong></h5></li><img src="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/german_shephard.jpeg.jpg"><br><p style= "color: yellow;"/>German shepherds don’t just make great police and search and rescue dogs—they also make for loving house pets. German shepherds are “high-energy and have more of a protective side,” according to DeMarco. He also adds that they’re highly intelligent and require lots of mental stimulation.

“With smart breed dogs, they tend to be more mischievous because they get bored easier,” <strong>DeMarco,</strong> says. To prevent this, you can stimulate your dog through training, sports, chew toys or nose work games.

German shepherds also respond well to commands, and are keen on having various “<em>jobs</em>.” The American Kennel Club describes them as “dogkind’s finest all-purpose worker.”

Health issues for this breed include hip and elbow dysplasia, degenerative myelopathy (a neurological disorder), Gastric dilatation and volvulus (GDV) and others.
<li><h6 class="sglow"><strong>Poodle</strong></h6></li><img src="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/poodle.jpeg.jpg">Poodles are known for being smart and social—and for their beautiful, high-maintenance coat. As one of the most intelligent dog breeds around, Poodles also need lots of exercise and brain games to be content.

Poodles come in a standard size, miniature size and toy size. Generally, poodles tend to be proud, playful, friendly and bright. They’re good with other pets, strangers and children, making them quite versatile.

When it comes to their coat, poodles need a lot of care. Rather than poodles being big shedders, their hair tends to get matted. To prevent this, you’ll need to brush them every other day. They will also need to be professionally clipped and groomed about every six weeks.

As far as health issues go, poodles are prone to gastric dilatation and volvulus (GDV), Cushing’s disease, eye issues like progressive retinal atrophy and more,
<li><h7 class= "sglow"><strong>Bulldog</strong></h7></li><img src="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bull_dog.jpeg.jpg"><p style= "color: orange;"/>The Bulldog is a British breed of dog of mastiff type. It may also be known as the English Bulldog or British Bulldog. It is a medium-sized, muscular dog of around 40–55 lb (18–25 kg). They have large heads with thick folds of skin around the face and shoulders and a relatively flat face with a protruding lower jaw. The breed has significant health issues as a consequence of breeding for its distinctive appearance, including brachycephaly, hip dysplasia, heat sensitivity, and skin infections. Due to concerns about their quality of life, breeding Bulldogs is illegal in Norway and the Netherlands
<li><h8 class= "sglow"><strong>Rottweiler</strong></h8></li><img src="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rottie.jpeg.jpg">

Rottweilers are in the working group of dog breeds, meaning that they thrive when they have an activity or “job.” Combined with their protective and alert nature, they make excellent watch or guard dogs. Despite this, they’re also a loving and loyal breed—with proper training and socialization, a rottie’s territorial instincts can be controlled.

A rottweiler is a big dog, typically standing between 22 to 27 inches and weighing between 80 to 135 pounds. They’re an active breed and are great for accompanying you on a jog or long walks, and they also enjoy games and sports.

Despite their protective nature, rottweilers aren’t known for being a very vocal breed. You won’t hear them bark much outside of protecting their territory and loved ones.

When it comes to health concerns, rottweilers tend to have higher cases of hip dysplasia, eye issues such as progressive retinal atrophy and cataracts, as well as heart issues.
<li><h9 class= "sglow"><strong>Beagle</strong></h9></li><img src= "https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/beagle.jpeg.jpg">Beagles are known for their floppy ears and colorful coats. Their personalities tend to be described as loveable, happy and curious. They’re part of the hound group and are often used as scent-detection dogs at airports.

Beagles are also an energetic breed and will need plenty of stimulation to thrive. Due to their keen nose, they may enjoy mental challenges with snuffle mats (a mat that can hide treats). Their preferred exercise is long walks with plenty of opportunities to sniff and explore. Just be sure to keep your dog’s leash short, as a beagle’s curiosity is known to make it wander.

Beagles have a low-maintenance coat with an average amount of shedding and require brushing just once a week.	
<li><h10 class= "sglow"><strong>Daschund</strong></h10></li><img src="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/daschund.jpeg.jpg">Often called “weiner dogs,” dachshunds are known for their long bodies and short legs. They’re funny, curious and have endless energy. But as with many small dogs, “they can be feisty,” DeMarco says.

“When you come into their house, they let you know that it’s their house,” DeMarco adds.

This also means that they tend to be a vocal breed. Dachshunds have a loud bark and will use it along with their bold personalities to express themselves.

A dachshund’s grooming needs depend on the type you have. Dachshunds have three different types of coats: short-haired, long-haired and wire-haired. Short-haired dachshunds don’t require much brushing but long-haired dachshunds have hair that can get matted if not brushed daily. Wire-haired dachshunds look like miniature schnauzers (another dog on this list)—and have a beard that needs to be cared for.

Health problems for dachshunds are mostly back problems due to their anatomy. IVDD is very prevalent in dachshunds. To prevent this, try to limit your dog from jumping off the sofa or any other strenuous exercise that can place stress on its back.<br><br>	
<li><h11 class= "sglow"><strong>German shorthaired pointer</strong></h11></li><img src="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pointer.jpeg.jpg">German shorthaired pointers are another breed that does well with a job, training and vigorous exercise. This is because they are highly intelligent and active dogs—historically, they’ve been used as efficient hunting dogs.

One interesting fact about this breed is that they’re known for pointing. A leftover instinct from their hunting nature, German shorthaired pointers will often stop and go into a “pointing” stance to show you something interesting. They’ve even been known to point while dreaming.

Due to their high-maintenance exercise and mental stimulation needs, German shorthaired pointers are not for relaxed, inactive owners.

German shorthaired pointers tend to be a vocal breed and will often bark and whine to get attention. Skin and ear infections, as well as eye diseases have also been noted as troublesome issues for the breed.

<head><strong>Top 10 dangerous dog breeds in the world</strong></head>
<p>This dogs are not dangerous its just that the owners are not taking care of them properly but according to the <strong>US</strong> statistics this dogs bite alot people in the last years</p>

  <li>pitbull terrier</li><img src= "https://www.dogster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/red-and-white-pitbull_Mary-Swift_Shutterstock.jpg"
">I have always been warned by adults about Pit Bulls as a kid. For example, i’ve been told that once a Pit Bull bites down, their jaws can lock with brute force. The term for this was “lock jaw.”  With these horror stories, there is an undeniable stigma attached to Pit Bulls.But what i’ve realized is that all of that was exaggerated. The reality is, the media and people like to put this bias on generalizing these dogs based on bad people’s actions. There are plenty of good Pit bulls that will never make the news.

There are no inherently “bad dogs.” But there are bad people that may treat these dogs in a manner that they tend to develop aggressive behavior, thus becoming “dangerous.”But if were looking at straight statistics, the Pit Bulls are considered to be the most dangerous breed. Despite earning the title as “most dangerous dog,” a Pit Bull can actually be a sweet dog.

They’re loyal, friendly and really do love people. If socialized and trained properly, a Pit Bull can be one of the best companion dogs. Unfortunately, many Pit Bull-related attacks are believed to be from dogs with irresponsible dog owners.

It’s not easy to properly raise a Pitbull. Some people use abusive behavior towards their Pit Bulls or specifically train them to attack. And because of their long history as bull baiting dogs, they need even more socializing and training to keep their instincts in check.

<li><strong><h12 class= "sglow">Rottwelier</h12></strong></li><img src="">The Rottweiler, or  <strong><em>“rottie,”</em></strong> isn’t just one of the most expensive dogs, but also one of the most dangerous breeds. To own a Rottweiler means you’ll have to pay a premium. But in return, you get one of the fiercest guard dogs that this world has to offer.

Make no mistake – Rottweilers have been slowly gaining popularity, going from the 10th to 8th most popular dog breed in a few short years. With an increase in the number of this ferocious guard dog, means an increase in the number of potential dog attacks.

Although the Rottweiler is generally a good-natured dog, they will do whatever it takes to protect the pack. Most owners will describe them as loyal, fearless, courageous and confident. All of which, are fantastic temperament traits of the perfect family guard dog.

In all fairness, the Rottweiler dog is a surprisingly calm dog breed. I’ve met many rotties in my life and they aren’t as vicious as they appear to be. My guess is there may be external factors and reasons for such a gentle dog to rank so high on this list.

For example, maybe all the fatalities were of robbers trying to break in the house. In that case, they were just doing their “job.” Whatever the reason, the numbers don’t lie – Rottweilers are still one of the most dangerous dog breeds.<br><br>
<li><strong><h13 class= "sglow">German shepherd</h13></strong></li><img src="https://thesmartcanine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/german-shepherd-dangerous-dog-768x514.jpg.webp">German Shepherds are the bread and butter of any reputable K-9 Unit. Many people believe the GSDs are synonymous with police dogs. But because they’re so dependable for fighting crime, if put in a bad situation, they can become dangerous.

The typical family-owned German Shepherd believes it has one job and purpose – to protect the family. With this kind of mentality and dedication, accidents can potentially happen.

As long as your German Shepherd perceives someone as being dangerous to the pack (your family), they will attack and defend. And not many people can withstand a German Shepherd attack.

The fact that they stand tall at 25 inches and weigh in at 80 pounds of pure muscle, the attack can be brutal and in some cases, fatal. Even if they don’t intend to, they can accidentally hurt a small kid with a simple whip of the tail.

The German Shepherd is by far the most popular family-owned guard dog in the United States. In fact, second only to the Labrador Retriever, they’re the most popular dog breed in America, period.

With the brute force, protective instincts and prevalence of the German Shepherd, are you really that surprised they rank so high on the dangerous breed list? We didn’t think so, either.

<li><strong><h14 class= "sglow">BULLDOG</h14></strong></li><img src= "https://thesmartcanine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bulldog-dangerous-dog-breed-768x512.jpg.webp">The Bulldog has received its fair share of criticism and controversy. For example, they’ve been (unfairly) named the dumbest dog breed in the world. As a result, many people ask: do their low intelligence have anything to do with their aggressive behavior?

Personally, I feel that they’re just misunderstood. Owners interpret their reluctance to comply with any commands and obedience instructions as a lack of intelligence. But in reality, they’re just really stubborn and independent dogs.

In actuality, this falls on the owner side. A Bulldog won’t do your bidding or obey your commands if you aren’t a firm and consistent leader of the pack (or family). Needless to say, these dogs aren’t the best for novice dog owners.

The fact that these dogs are so difficult to train and control raises an issue. But let’s consider this. Perhaps the fact that Bulldogs occasionally attack humans is because the owners couldn’t adequately train their dog.

Bulldogs are often described as friendly, social and docile dogs. However there is a lot of work and attention when it comes to these dogs. If properly socialized and trained, there should be no reason for them to attack a person for no apparent reason.
<li><strong><h15 class= "sglow">English mastiff</h15></strong>
</li><img src= "https://thesmartcanine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/english-mastiff-dangerous-breed-768x510.jpg.webp">An English Mastiff is, by nature, docile and gentle – at least, for the most part. However, like with all big dogs, the Mastiff can become aggressive for a variety of reasons. For instance, neglect and bad training will do the trick.<br><br>

The Mastiff is naturally aloof with strangers. So, it’s very important for Mastiffs to receive socialization training early on. According to trainers, it’s the only way they can learn to read normal behaviors of “the good guys.”<br><br>

But without socialization, it’s quite possible they will become suspicious of everyone outside the family. In addition, the protective instincts of the Mastiff will kick in and they may be over-protective, which often leads to dangerous situations.



This type of “mindset” in the Mastiff often leads to unusual shyness and aggression with people. Both of which, are behaviors that can be dangerous with a dog of this size. Weighing up to 230 pounds, they can do a lot of damage.

If they want to attack, they will do it with relative ease. And if you are an owner looking to keep a Mastiff, you’ll have a lot of responsibility training this strong-willed dog<br><br>

  <strong><h16 class= "sglow">Siberian Husky</h16></strong><img src="https://thesmartcanine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Husky-dangerous-dog-768x494.jpg.webp">If you haven’t been living under a rock, you may have seen funny memes of an evil husky circulating the web. Sure, they may look “evil” with their sinister-looking eyes and the black fur that surrounds it. But, are they really that dangerous or aggressive?<br><br>

Most huskies are friendly and social creatures. They simply love people. Most owners will tell you that the Husky is intelligent, alert, and gentle to all creatures. However, the problem is that Huskies are always full of energy and extremely active, which may lead to aggressive tendencies.<br><br>

Looking into isolated incidents, I can tell that many of these fatal attacks by Huskies involved small kids. It’s not generally a great idea to let large dogs play with small children, especially if the dog is energetic and aren’t familiar with the kids.<br><br>

But regardless of the victim’s size and age, the Siberian Huskies are indeed dangerous breeds according to the bite fatality statistics in America. Though when properly trained and socialized, these dogs can still be lovable and playful dog companions for any home.<br><br>
