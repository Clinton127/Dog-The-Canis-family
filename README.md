    <h2 class="sglow">About Dogs</h2>
    <p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over <em>14,000 years ago</em> and before the development of agriculture. Experts estimate that due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.<br><br></p>

<p>Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones <strong>(with the exception of the tail),</strong> powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared to humans, dogs have an inferior visual acuity, a superior sense of smell, and a relatively large olfactory cortex. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military.

Communication in dogs includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste).<br><br> They mark their territories by urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a new environment. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior; this adaptation includes being able to understand and communicate with humans. The human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent study, and dogs' influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".

The global dog population is estimated at 700 million to 1 billion, distributed around the world. The dog is the most popular pet in the United States, present in 34–40% of households. In developed countries, around 20% of dogs are kept as pets, while 75% of the population in developing countries largely consists of feral and community dogs.</p>

    <h3>Breeds</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><h3 class= "sglow"><strong>French Bulldog</strong></h3></li><img src= "https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/french_bull_dog.jpeg.jpg"><br><p style= "color: green;"/>The French bulldog is a small, nonsporting dog that originated in France from crosses between small native dogs and toy Bulldogs. It has a short, smooth coat that comes in various colors, such as brindle, fawn, and white. It has large, erect ears that resemble those of a bat. It is an affectionate and easygoing house dog that thrives on attention and has low exercise requirements13. It typically weighs around 16-28 pounds (7-13 kg) and lives for about 10-12 years.<br><br>
<li><h3 class= "sglow"><strong>Labrador retriever</strong></h3></li><img src= "https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/retriever.jpeg.jpg"><br><p style= "color: blue;"/>The Labrador retriever has long been synonymous with the perfect family dog. As playful, energetic and loyal dogs, they’re ideal for almost any living situation. They’re also easy to train since they’re eager to please their owners.

An intelligent dog with boundless energy, the Labrador retriever will need a good amount of space and time to exercise. More than two hours of exercise per day is recommended for this breed, according to The Kennel Club. They also need mental stimulation—think puzzle feeders or toys, training and sports.

Labs have a thick double coat so they are prone to shedding, but you can reduce this by brushing them at least once per week. During high-shedding seasons like spring and fall, you may need to brush them daily.
<li><h4 class= "sglow"> <strong>Golden retriever</strong></h4></li><img src="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/golden.jpeg.jpg"><br><p style="color: red:"/>Golden retrievers, similar to their labrador counterparts, are also wonderful family companions. Gentle and friendly, these dogs are known for their affectionate and loving demeanor.

When it comes to exercise, goldens need more than two hours a day, per The Kennel Club. These smart and active dogs love playing fetch and swimming. They also require mental stimulation and do well with training.

Goldens have a longer and thicker coat than labradors, making them high shedders. It’s recommended to brush them daily or at least twice per week.

These canines have similar health concerns to <em>labradors</em>, as they’re also prone to hip dysplasia, ACL tears and joint issues. Research also suggests that goldens unfortunately have a higher risk of cancer than most dogs.


<li><h5 class= "sglow"><strong>German shepherd</strong></h5></li><img src="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/german_shephard.jpeg.jpg"><br><p style= "color: yellow;"/>German shepherds don’t just make great police and search and rescue dogs—they also make for loving house pets. German shepherds are “high-energy and have more of a protective side,” according to DeMarco. He also adds that they’re highly intelligent and require lots of mental stimulation.

“With smart breed dogs, they tend to be more mischievous because they get bored easier,” <strong>DeMarco,</strong> says. To prevent this, you can stimulate your dog through training, sports, chew toys or nose work games.

German shepherds also respond well to commands, and are keen on having various “<em>jobs</em>.” The American Kennel Club describes them as “dogkind’s finest all-purpose worker.”

Health issues for this breed include hip and elbow dysplasia, degenerative myelopathy (a neurological disorder), Gastric dilatation and volvulus (GDV) and others.
<li><h6 class="sglow"><strong>Poodle</strong></h6></li><img src="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/poodle.jpeg.jpg">Poodles are known for being smart and social—and for their beautiful, high-maintenance coat. As one of the most intelligent dog breeds around, Poodles also need lots of exercise and brain games to be content.

Poodles come in a standard size, miniature size and toy size. Generally, poodles tend to be proud, playful, friendly and bright. They’re good with other pets, strangers and children, making them quite versatile.

When it comes to their coat, poodles need a lot of care. Rather than poodles being big shedders, their hair tends to get matted. To prevent this, you’ll need to brush them every other day. They will also need to be professionally clipped and groomed about every six weeks.

As far as health issues go, poodles are prone to gastric dilatation and volvulus (GDV), Cushing’s disease, eye issues like progressive retinal atrophy and more,
<li><h7 class= "sglow"><strong>Bulldog</strong></h7></li><img src="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bull_dog.jpeg.jpg"><p style= "color: orange;"/>The Bulldog is a British breed of dog of mastiff type. It may also be known as the English Bulldog or British Bulldog. It is a medium-sized, muscular dog of around 40–55 lb (18–25 kg). They have large heads with thick folds of skin around the face and shoulders and a relatively flat face with a protruding lower jaw. The breed has significant health issues as a consequence of breeding for its distinctive appearance, including brachycephaly, hip dysplasia, heat sensitivity, and skin infections. Due to concerns about their quality of life, breeding Bulldogs is illegal in Norway and the Netherlands
<li><h8 class= "sglow"><strong>Rottweiler</strong></h8></li><img src="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/rottie.jpeg.jpg">

Rottweilers are in the working group of dog breeds, meaning that they thrive when they have an activity or “job.” Combined with their protective and alert nature, they make excellent watch or guard dogs. Despite this, they’re also a loving and loyal breed—with proper training and socialization, a rottie’s territorial instincts can be controlled.

A rottweiler is a big dog, typically standing between 22 to 27 inches and weighing between 80 to 135 pounds. They’re an active breed and are great for accompanying you on a jog or long walks, and they also enjoy games and sports.

Despite their protective nature, rottweilers aren’t known for being a very vocal breed. You won’t hear them bark much outside of protecting their territory and loved ones.

When it comes to health concerns, rottweilers tend to have higher cases of hip dysplasia, eye issues such as progressive retinal atrophy and cataracts, as well as heart issues.
<li><h9 class= "sglow"><strong>Beagle</strong></h9></li><img src= "https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/beagle.jpeg.jpg">Beagles are known for their floppy ears and colorful coats. Their personalities tend to be described as loveable, happy and curious. They’re part of the hound group and are often used as scent-detection dogs at airports.

Beagles are also an energetic breed and will need plenty of stimulation to thrive. Due to their keen nose, they may enjoy mental challenges with snuffle mats (a mat that can hide treats). Their preferred exercise is long walks with plenty of opportunities to sniff and explore. Just be sure to keep your dog’s leash short, as a beagle’s curiosity is known to make it wander.

Beagles have a low-maintenance coat with an average amount of shedding and require brushing just once a week.	
<li><h10 class= "sglow"><strong>Daschund</strong></h10></li><img src="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/daschund.jpeg.jpg">Often called “weiner dogs,” dachshunds are known for their long bodies and short legs. They’re funny, curious and have endless energy. But as with many small dogs, “they can be feisty,” DeMarco says.

“When you come into their house, they let you know that it’s their house,” DeMarco adds.

This also means that they tend to be a vocal breed. Dachshunds have a loud bark and will use it along with their bold personalities to express themselves.

A dachshund’s grooming needs depend on the type you have. Dachshunds have three different types of coats: short-haired, long-haired and wire-haired. Short-haired dachshunds don’t require much brushing but long-haired dachshunds have hair that can get matted if not brushed daily. Wire-haired dachshunds look like miniature schnauzers (another dog on this list)—and have a beard that needs to be cared for.

Health problems for dachshunds are mostly back problems due to their anatomy. IVDD is very prevalent in dachshunds. To prevent this, try to limit your dog from jumping off the sofa or any other strenuous exercise that can place stress on its back.<br><br>	
<li><h11 class= "sglow"><strong>German shorthaired pointer</strong></h11></li><img src="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pointer.jpeg.jpg">German shorthaired pointers are another breed that does well with a job, training and vigorous exercise. This is because they are highly intelligent and active dogs—historically, they’ve been used as efficient hunting dogs.

One interesting fact about this breed is that they’re known for pointing. A leftover instinct from their hunting nature, German shorthaired pointers will often stop and go into a “pointing” stance to show you something interesting. They’ve even been known to point while dreaming.

Due to their high-maintenance exercise and mental stimulation needs, German shorthaired pointers are not for relaxed, inactive owners.

German shorthaired pointers tend to be a vocal breed and will often bark and whine to get attention. Skin and ear infections, as well as eye diseases have also been noted as troublesome issues for the breed.
